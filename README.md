# recipe-voice-interface

The goal of this project is to make cooking and baking easier. Siri can act as a voice interface to personal recipes and answer simple questions. This program doesn't incorporate a large language model (LLM) (the initial goal was to use openai api, but there is no free trial anymore) and can't reason, so it's important to provide the recipe name and ask simple questions like:

- How long should I bake banana bread?
- How much flour should I add in my banana bread?
- What are all the ingredients in banana bread?
- Can you show me all the ingredients in banana bread?
- What are the instructions to banana bread?

Recipes can be added and modified in the browser.
